# Transmission on Raspberry Pi as a Docker Container

2018-10-29, Ognjen VukoviÄ‡

## Description

Transmission is a lightweight BitTorrent client which features a variety of user interfaces on top of a cross-platform back-end.

The goal of this guide is to provide steps on how to run transmission as a stateless container.
In order to achieve that, the interfaces between the container and the host system needs to be properly designed. For example, all state information (e.g., configuration and downloaded data) needs to be stored on the actual host and attached to the container
through volume binding/mounting.

### Container Interfaces

State information:

* Configuration directory - where `transmission` looks for configuration files
    * The location can be set in the `TRANSMISSION_HOME` environment variable
    * If `TRANSMISSION_HOME` is not set, the default location on Unix-based systems is `$HOME/.config/`
    * The location can also be passed at the run time as the argument `--config-dir`
* Download directory - where `transmission` saves downloaded data
    * The location of the directory with downloaded files is specified in the configuration file as `download-dir`
    * The location of the directory with incomplete files is specified in the configuration file as `incomplete-dir`
        * The directory is not enabled by default, and it can be enabled in the configuration file by setting `incomplete-dir-enabled` to `true`.
* Watch directory - where `transmission` watches for new .torrent files
    * The location of the directory with downloaded files is specified in the configuration file as `watch-dir`
    * The directory is not enabled by default, and it can be enabled in the configuration file by setting `watch-dir-enabled` to `true`

Communication ports:

* Incoming/Listening ports:
    * Web interface (TCP)
        * The port number is specified in the configuration file as `rpc-port`
        * The default value is `9091`
    * Incoming connections for data sharing (TCP and UDP)
        * The port number is specified in the configuration file as `peer-port`
        * The default value is `51413`

* Outgoing ports (TCP and UDP):
    * Outgoing connections to establish connections with other peers.
        * The port range is specified in the configuration file as from `peer-port-random-low` to `peer-port-random-high`
        * The default range is `49152` to `65535`

## Prerequisites
* Keep the settings file outside of the container

# Build the docker image
`$ docker build -t home-it/transmission .`

# Create a container
```
$ docker create --name=transmission \
-v /srv/transmission/config:/transmission/config \
-v /media/HDD_XFS_Sgt/Downloads/Torrents:/transmission/downloads \
-v /srv/transmission/watch:/transmission/watch \
-e TGID=$(id -g $USER) -e TUID=$(id -u $USER) \
-p 9091:9091 -p 51413:51413 -p 51413:51413/udp \
home-it/transmission
```

# Run the container
`$ docker start transmission`

# Stop the container
`$ docker stop transmission`

# /config - where transmission stores config files and logs
# /downloads - for downloads
# /watch - watch folder for torrent files
# PGID and PUID - ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will
# TZ for timezone information
